Instead of working with a command line, it is more user-friendly to have a graphical user interface, where the user just 
needs to switch some UI buttons.
Therefore, we need to create a client-server architecture, where the server handles user requests.
We decided to use the `express` package, which offers simple REST endpoints.



As a reference, the full server code can be found in the [server.ts](src/server/server.ts) file, while the 
client can be found in the [client](./src/client) directory.
